
Thanks for downloading the source code files for Beginning CSS.



You can download either all the code in one zip
 (Beginning CSS 3ed code samples.zip) or you can download the individual chapters. (Note that there are no code examples for Chapter 19, "Closing Comments", Appendix A, 
"Answers to Exercises", Appendix B, "Additional CSS Resources", Appendix C, 
"CSS Reference", or Appendix D, "CSS Colors".

Each 
chapter has its own folder, where you will find all of the code that is 
labelled in the book for download, as well as all of the Try It Out code, and 
additional files such as images and fonts.



The code samples will save you from having to type code that is often repetitive - 
no one needs to type in a DOCTYPE 127 times - but it also gives you a starting 
point from which to experiment. 

I encourage you to play with 
the code in this book by changing values, adding background images, and using 
entirely new properties of CSS. For each chapter with code I have given an 
'extra credit' task, a change to make to the code that will either reinforce 
what you have learned in the chapter, or that requires you to research an aspect of 
CSS that isn't covered in the book.



Have fun!

 
Ian Pouncey.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



Chapter 1, "Introducing Cascading Style Sheets":
 This chapter is about becoming familiar with writing CSS and HTML. 
Extra Credit TasK: Add information for the missing planets, creating and displaying an image of each planet.



Chapter 2, "The Bits That Make Up a Style Sheet":
 We still haven't gotten to the interesting stuff yet, but there is a lot to 
    get used to. 
Extra Credit TasK: Set the color of the text in this chapter, and try converting 
one type of unit to a different form: pixels to ems, RGB color values to Hexadecimal.



Chapter 3, "Selectors":
 Now we are getting somewhere! 
Extra Credit TasK: Update your 'extra credit' code from Chapter 1, so that each planet is given an ID instead of a class. Give the links a 
:visited and :active pseudo-class.



Chapter 4, "The Cascade and Inheritance":
 This is the final chapter covering the basic parts of CSS. 
Extra Credit TasK: An important skill to learn when writing CSS selectors is to keep their specificity as low as possible. Look through all of the CSS in this and the previous 
chapters, including the new CSS you have written for 'extra credit', and 
re-write the selectors so that they have the lowest specificity they can have while not changing how the HTML is styled.

Chapter 5, "Applying Font Faces":
 At last, our first properties! 
Extra Credit TasK: Find out what fonts you have available on your computer and change the text in this chapter's code to use some of them. Figure out a few combinations that work together, as well as what doesn't.



Chapter 6, "Manipulating The Display Of Text":
 More text in this chapter, this time properties that allow you to control some of the more subtle aspects of typography. 
Extra Credit TasK: See if you can figure out how to make the heading text in one of the Try It Out examples disappear using only the text-indent property.



Chapter 7, "Background Colors And Images":
 Backgrounds can really liven up a page, but images that are good for examples don't necessarily make for an attractive web site. 
Extra Credit TasK: With Example 1 as your starting point, create or find a background image that enhances the page content. You may need to change the text color so that the 
    content remains readable.

Chapter 8, "The Box Model, Controlling Margins, Borders, Padding, Width, and Height":
 Usually the elements in HTML are of the appropriate type by default - a <p> is a block element and a <span> is an inline element, and this is 
what we want. We don't expect <p> elements to appear side-by-side, but one after another. There is, however, a 'display' property that changes 
block to inline and inline to block, or even hides the content completely. 
Extra Credit TasK: Search for information about this property and apply it to the code in this chapter.



Chapter 9, "Floating and Vertical Alignment":
 In this chapter I show you how to use the 'clear' property to cancel floats. There are ways to cause a floated element to clear itself, so that 
you don't have to rely on the following element to have a 'clear' property. 
Extra Credit TasK: Read http://webstandardstips.com/2008/11/18/easy-clearing-of-floats/ including the first comment by Steve Webster and the second comment by the 
    site author, isofarro, to learn how,and apply your new knowledge to figure_9-6.html

.

Chapter 10, "Styling Lists":
 With a bit of work you can make ordered lists really stand out. 
Extra Credit TasK: Try creating your own numbers as images, and apply them to the lists in 
example_10-2.html. You will have to give each <li> element a class to make this work, so make it worth the effort!



Chapter 11, "Positioning Content Within a Document":
 For Chapter 6 I asked you to find out how to make text disappear using text-indent. 
Extra Credit TasK: There is a way to make any type of content disappear with
 'position: absolute'. See if you can work out what it is.



Chapter 12, "Styling Tables": Another task for designers - the examples in this chapter are functional 
 but not what you might consider good looking. 
Extra Credit TasK:  Using the properties you learned in this and the preceding chapters work some magic and make these tables look great.

 

Chapter 13, "Create a Complete Layout":
 In this chapter I introduce some goodies from CSS3: custom fonts and 
background gradients. 
Extra Credit TasK: Another common aspect of visual design that CSS3 
 makes simple in modern browsers is rounded corners. Research how to use 
the 'border-radius' property.



Chapter 14, "Advanced Selectors":
 For Chapter 4 I asked you to rewrite the CSS you had encountered so far to use the selectors with the lowest specificity possible. 
Extra Credit TasK: Now that you have 
advanced selectors at your disposal look through the code you have written so far and see if you can find cases where they can be used to reduce complexity and lower specificity.



Chapter 15, "Styling for Print":
 This chapter shows you how to target CSS at printed content, but the styles are a little bland. 
Extra Credit TasK: Use your design skills to make the site from Chapter 13 worth being printed.



Chapter 16, "Customizing the Mouse Cursor":
 I say in this chapter that custom pointers are beyond the scope of this book, and rightly so because they are very rarely used. 
Extra Credit TasK: You never know when you will need to maintain a site that uses them though, so do a 
little research on using the 'cursor' property with a 'url' value.



Chapter 17, "Controlling Opacity And Visibility":
 I don't show you how to make content opaque in IE 6, 7, and 8, because it usually just isn't worth it. I believe that users of the best browsers should get the best experience, and they won't if you spend valuable time making things work in out of date browsers. Extra Credit TasK: Sometimes a client might insist though, or you'll have to work with someone else's CSS, so a bit more research is in order to learn how to bend Internet Explorer to your will.



Chapter 18, "Styling Content for Mobile Devices":
 Mobile is the future! I've shown you the examples in this chapter on an iPhone because at the time of writing that's the device all the cool kids 
have. However, there are many other devices that are picking up market share, particularly phones running Google's Android, and Opera Mobile has an impressive market share around the world. 
Extra Credit TasK: Upload the examples to a 
 server (or even better, add CSS targeting mobile devices to your own site), and view them on as many different phones as you can.
